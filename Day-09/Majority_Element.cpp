Problem: Majority Element (LC #169)
========================================

Problem Statement:
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Approach Used:
Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm
- Maintain a candidate element and a frequency counter.
- If the frequency becomes 0, choose the current element as the new candidate.
- Increment the frequency if the current element matches the candidate,
  otherwise decrement it.
- The final candidate will be the majority element.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Why This Approach?
Since the majority element appears more than n/2 times, it will always remain
as the final candidate after canceling out all other elements using the
Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm.

Concepts Used:
Arrays, Greedy Strategy, Voting Algorithm
